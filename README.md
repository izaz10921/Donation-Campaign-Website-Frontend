# React + Vite

3 project features

-Donation card:
 One of the most important feature of this project is Donation card.If I click any card from the home page it will take me to the card details page.In the card details page if i click the donate button the data of the card will added into the browser local storage.Then from the local storage I load the data into the donation page and each of the donate card is added into the donation page.

-Statistics pie chart:
In  this chart I show the donation amount percentage from the donation card by comparing with the total donation percentage.For this I use both the useLoadData hook and local Storage to get the data of the donation card and total card.

-Error page :
If I type any wrong route in the browser search bar it will take me to a error page and this page show me a message.Here I use the errorElement to make this path.
